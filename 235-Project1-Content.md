## Concept
  Take on the role of an NFL GM, build your perfect team with your favorite players, and compete with all the other teams in the NFL to   claim the ultimate NFL Title, Super Bowl Champion!!

## Genre
  Football based Strategy Card Game

## Platform:
  PC only
  
## Story
  Take on the role of a rookie NFL GM. Start with a team of base player cards and play to gain stronger cards to build your team.
  Build up your team to be strong enough to beat all the other teams and gain the title of Super Bowl Champion
  
## Aesthetics
  Graphics: Fairly basic since its a card game. Limited animations. A UI that will look similar to a retro football game for where the 
            ball is and what the score is.
     
  Sound: Basic sound. Background music similar to that of Primetime football themes. Sound effects upon actions.

## Gameplay
  ### Mechanics
    Each play, the offensive player(whether its the player or the CPU team) will get to choose a play type(run or pass).
    They will then randomly receive three players from their team from that side of the ball(ie three defensive players on defense)
    They then can choose one of those three players to be their teams "captain" for that play.
    Each of the two teams captains will then face-off. 
      All players will have two stats: Offense has Pass and Rush, Defensive has Pass Defense and Rush Defense(more may be added)
      Based on the players stats, the plays outcome will be determined(Yards gained or lost and chances for turnovers)
    This cycles until the game is over. Highest score wins. There will be a timer and a certain amount of time will tick off each play.
  
  ### Game Learning
    At the start of the game there will be a tutorial game against a very bad cpu team. The player will be guaranteed to win and given         
    instructions on how to play the game.
  
  ### Player learning
    The biggest player learning aspect of the game will be how the player builds their team. They will only be able to get limited players
    so who they choose to keep on their team will have a huge impact on if they can win games. The fact that you can only choose from three 
    random players on your team makes it so you can not just have one really good card that you can ride to wins. That being said, you can
    choose to build your team in unlimited different ways and choose to build a passing or rushing based team, or a balanced approach. There
    is also a decent amount of game knowledge about what play types to choose and when. Passes are higher risk, higher reward, while
    rushing is safer. So depending on what you need, you will have to choose correctly. Also may add some more play type options and stats 
    if time permits to further this aspect of the game.
